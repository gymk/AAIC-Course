Much uglier than that of black tea. I do not trust this tea and would not offer it to anyone else.

Schneider,10,13,5,1084838400,Tim Burton Goes All Out in His Second Feature Film!,"Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

If you tried the ""new and improved"" Enfamil Toddler formula and hated it, good news! This 5-pack 15oz Enfamil appears to be the original toddler formula that our kids loved, that doesn't leave a greasy film and doesn't curdle. It is NOT the ""new and improved"" natural milk flavor one with corn syrup as the second ingredient that has parents up in arms.<br /><br />The packaging and label on the amazon listing look the same, but it arrives in a plain box with five refill bags. It has:<br />* nonfat milk and vegetable oil (palm olein, soy, coconut and sunflower oils), instead of the whole milk of the ""new"" version<br />* corn syrup solids as the third ingredient, not the second<br />* no natural flavoring added<br />* the formula doesn't curdle after an hour and there is no greasy film, so washing bottles is a whole lot easier.<br />* the same 160 calories per 8 fluid oz as the new version; however, protein has been reduced, from 6 to 4 grams. Carbohydrates are down as well, from 21 to 16.8 grams. Fat has increased, from 6 to 8.5 g. 860 g of linoleic acid now appear on the label. In terms of vitamins Iodine, Selenium and Vitamin B12 have been added. Please see comments for additional nutrition information.<br /><br />I've also found cans with the same ""old"" formula recently in stores (with nonfat milk as the first ingredient), mixed in with the new version with whole milk. It can be confusing so you'll need to read the label to know which is which. It's not clear if the manufacturer has quietly started phasing out its new and improved version (the refill packs with the non-fat milk formula have a 2013 expiration date vs the new formula which said 2012). In any case, it's great if they have as I haven't found another alternative for toddler formula I liked.<br /><br />The Enfamil Toddler formula is balanced nutritionally for toddlers. However, it is expensive so for my twins, I'm looking at other alternatives to supplement their meals, instead of toddler formula. with a balanced diet is just as good nutritionally and a lot less expensive.Carnation Instant Breakfast No Sugar Added, Chocolate, 8 ct (Quantity of 4) can provide added nutrition and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKBW"">PediaSure Nutrition Drink, Lactose Free, Vanilla, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> is indicated for weight gain and to fill in nutritional gaps, especially if you have a picky eater.<br /><br />As always, check with your pediatrician when making a change in formula or diet."

The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

First of  all, it is completely original and it is unlike any film I have ever seen  before. Second of all, it's a great comedy with kind of a spooky, weird  feel to it, which is something all of Tim Burton's films have. The look of  the film is probably what I like the best. Art Director Bo Welch and Tim  Burton show us a world unlike anything seen in a movie.  This is a great  film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable,  entertaining film that is original and inventive."

Never had a problem with a single order until today. Advertised as 6 boxes of 20 bags each. WELL! Not only is the price today about $2 less than what I was charged two days ago -  I received only 5 out of 6 boxes? Hmmmm. Hoping Amazon Customer Service comes through with a shipment of that extra box of tea that I paid for. If not, Amazon will be losing a good, regular customer. As for the tea itself, it does not relieve ""tension"" (a Shiatsu massage will). It does, however, appear to promote relaxation and impart a sense of calm with every sip. You'll get over the slightly stinky smell in a few cups. The taste will grow on you.<br /><br />UPDATE (one day later): Amazon has notified me that they have shipped a free box of tea! Now THAT is good customer service. Thanks, Amazon! I'll be sticking around! :-)"
