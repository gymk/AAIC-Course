Sherwin,3,3,5,1185580800,Vanilla caramel Coffee-mate is TOPS in my book !!!,"Vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate makes for an excellent milk or cream substitute for people who want a cup of coffee, cocoa or even tea when they don't have access to a refrigerator to keep milk or cream on hand. Coffee-mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but it adds so much extra flavor to your beverage that you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!<br /><br />Coffee-mate is easy enough to use--just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want to sweeten with this wonderful vanilla caramel taste.<br /><br />I would use vanilla caramel Coffee-mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.<br /><br />The nutrition label claims it contains no trans-fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans-fats in Coffee-mate are present but very negligible.<br /><br />Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website. They provide you with the website address and a toll free number if you have more questions about vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate.<br /><br />Overall, vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate provides an excellent, sweet tasting substitute for milk, cream and anything else that contains lactose. You may want to use it to sweeten your coffee, tea or cocoa even if you have access to fresh refrigerated milk that you can use. It's THAT good.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!"

Feldman ""Technophile""",4,4,5,1327536000,Bookers is a massive flavor bomb of cask strength bourbon richness.,"The top of the line of Jim Beam's Small Batch Collection, Bookers is a 127.9 proof monster (at least my current bottle).  Booker's a single barrel offering, and varies by proof and age from 121 to 127 proof (according to the web site, because the distiller chooses casks by flavor each cask is unique) and from 6-8 years in the barrel (for the same reason).  I guess my 127.9 proof example is ""pushing the envelope"" for Bookers.  I'm not complaining.  Alcohol is a flavor carrier and Bookers is a big flavor bomb.<br /><br />The dark tea orange color speaks of a heavy char in the barrels and you can smell it.  The toffee caramel aromas mix with the char to produce dark chocolate / cocoa notes.  There's also vanilla and tobacco and leather in there.  As Master Series reviewer Paul Pacult notes - there a ""paraffin"" note.<br /><br />Take a sip and pure sweetness hits first.  An intense sugar hit like maple syrup right on the tip of your tongue.  The midpalate mammoth wallop of orange fruit (citrus / apricot), toffee, and caramel corn hit a nanosecond later followed by spirit heat, wood tannins, oiled leather and vanilla aromatics from oak.  That paraffin note I own to Paul Pacult shows up here as well.  The high proof makes itself known in the huge midpalate hit and in a big spicy burn which hangs on for minutes as this bourbon finishes long and simple with a wood smoke, sugar glow, sourmash twang, and burnt orange throat bitterness.<br /><br />Wow!  I'm after another sip right away, but at this high a proof I must take my time.  The first big question is ""can I use water""?  You always can, but sometimes it robs a whiskey of its heart.  The answer here is ""yes you can"".  You can put quite a bit of water into Bookers and it still tastes clearly of Bookers (i.e. delicious).  It loses some intensity (particularly the aroma and midpalate explosion) but might gain something in the fruit esters department.  It certainly is easier to drink with some water.<br /><br />Bookers is clearly the most powerful bourbon flavor experience I've had so far.  The flavor profile is first rate too:  distinctive, complex, and luscious.  Excellent stuff!"

She drops at least a kitten worth of hair a week and I had been constantly finding balls of hair that have drifted under furniture every time I sweep the hardwood floors. I've been using the FURminator shampoo for a couple years and that definitely helps. The one bummer with the shampoo is that hair is flying off of her for several hours after a bath. It's excellent at getting the hair loose but it doesn't all come off in the bath. The conditioner seems to solve that problem. I would estimate that the amount of hair in the hair trap after giving her a bath is about double when I use the conditioner after using the shampoo and I no longer have the hair blowout problem for a couple hours after her bath. Don't get me wrong, she still sheds but not anywhere near as much. Now the ongoing battle of everything being covered in dog hair is a winnable battle. The amount of daily shedding that occurs is significantly less as well. My Golden has problems with allergies and can be sensitive to a lot of products. I've seen absolutely no reaction to either the shampoo or this conditioner on her.

The toxicologist recommended that I stop using any formula that contains brown rice syrup as its principal ingredient along with any other baby food products with it until they have more information. He mentioned the Dartmouth study stating the brown rice syrup has well over the recommended amount of inorganic arsenic, about 6x times past the limit.<br /><br />It was a relief to hear from the toxicologist that I need not worry about any acute or chronic arsenic toxicity for my baby, and that she does not require any urine, blood or hair tests.  This is in contrast to what many other pediatricians have recommended for their parents who are feeding their children the same formula.  The toxicologist believes that my daughter's risks to developing any illness, cancer etc was less than 1% greater than a child who had not been given the formula, so that was very reassuring.<br /><br />After hearing these recommendations from Children's Hospital I could see how someone would still continue using the Natures One product because the health risks are low, however I opted to switch because I realize my role as a parent is to reduce any risks to my child, even if it is less than 1%. There are so many other chemical risks out there that I feel any risks that you can take off the table would help protect my child because it is probably the cumulative effect off all these chemicals that leads to adverse problems. And i figure if those people who have a Masters in Public Health are recommending to discontinue it who am I to disagree with them.<br /><br />An ethical company would have taken the Dartmouth study information and told the public that they will try to improve on their product, ie. reduce the inorganic arsenic, however, they still claim they make the finest baby formula out there.  Their website says they are looking out for the health of our children but refuse to recall or change their product which speaks for itself.<br /><br />In light of them deleting my post above from their Facebook page, it appears that they definitely have something to hide, as I was just posting public health information that I felt people in my situation would like to know given to me by one of the most reputable health institutions (Children's Hospital) in the world.<br /><br />Obviously, I would give this product zero stars if I could.  Hope this info helps some of those confused, concerned parents out there like me.<br /><br />UPDATE #1*** please read the article from the Huffington Post written Dr. Gary Ginsberg, a toxicologist from Yale.  It is in line with the recommendations from Children's Hospital of Boston.<br /><br />UPDATE #2*** I received a response from Dr. Gary Ginsburg in response to the new testing results by Nature's One.  Looks like their testing results indicate an even worse situation than originally thought.  Here is the response from Dr. Ginsburg: ""Seeing your comment made me hopeful that this is just lab error, a false alarm. However, saying that Dartmouth doesn't know how to measure arsenic is like saying Roger Federer doesn't know how to play tennis. The Nature's One press release sounded scientific - they explain how the Dartmouth analysis was different from their method and why theirs was better. But when you click on their own results - in 3 samples of their baby formula, the inorganic arsenic is actually greater (53 to 83 ppb) than the Dartmouth results (10-20 ppb)!! So calling the Dartmouth results too high and flawed is an insult to Dartmouth as well as to all of us. Further, they compare their results to an outmoded WHO (CODEX) arsenic acceptable intake of 2.1 ug/kg/d. This was withdrawn in the latest CODEX because it was too close to the cancer effect level and CODEX did not supply a new value. Nature One claims that Dartmouth relied on the 2.1 ug/kg/d value but in fact Dartmouth used 0.3 ug/kg/d (the dose corresponding to USEPA's drinking water std) to compare against. If Nat1 used that target, their baby formula would be in the danger zone, so they chose the withdrawn target instead. The bottom line is that the company's own data make the situation worse, with levels of arsenic in their baby formula 5 to 8 times greater than the USEPA drinking water standard for inorganic arsenic (10 ppb)."""

This was the first product we tried out of the 5 we were sent to test and it lasted less then ten minutes in my home. My toddler was anxious to give them a try and I have already purchased two more boxes since we tasted the first one. They will definitely be a staple product. I love that they are from a trusted brand and I love that they are made with whole grains and I can feel good about my snack choice!
